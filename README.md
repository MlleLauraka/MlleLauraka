Hi, It's Laura Kouadio, Welcome to my GitHub!

Me in a few words: Fast paced learner and natural investigator, I am directing my skills toward data sciences and analytics to extract the best insights out of data and help you make meaningful decisions. I believe that working in a challenging business is vital for personal achievement. With international communication skills and a good team spirit, I have a great capacity to adapt to new environments, cultures, and methods.


I'm looking forward to hear about you.
